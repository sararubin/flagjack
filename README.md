FlagJack
========

FlagJack is an augmented reality mobile video game built explicitly for the iOS platform. The
game pits two teams against each other in a fight to capture the opponent's flag and return it to
home base. Using the iOS device's screen as a heads-up display, virtual information is visually
presented to the user: a player is alerted when nearing the enemy's flag, when approaching an
enemy team member, and perhaps most importantly, when their own flag is stolen!

FlagJack is perfect for an urban environment and games of all sizes, from two to ten players per
team. This modern twist on the classic game of capture the flag allows for new strategies for
defending a flag, and exciting instances of attacking the enemy's flag â€“ if you can slip by the
enemy's iOS-device-radar!
